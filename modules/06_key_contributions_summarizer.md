# Module 06 – Key Contributions Summarizer

## Purpose
Identify major contribution statements directly from text without extrapolation.

---

## Identification
Look for:
- “We propose…”
- “This work introduces…”
- “Our main contribution…”
- Claimed novelty or performance improvements *only if explicit*

---

## Output Rules
- 3–6 bullets
- Each bullet one factual sentence from the text
- No invented metrics or vague claims

---

## Warning Case
If unclear or not stated:
“Insufficient information: contribution statements are not explicit.”
